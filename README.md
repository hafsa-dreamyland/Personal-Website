## About the Website
This is a personal website project aimed to create a digital space for my projects. The design emphasizes a modern and user-friendly experience, incorporating sleek visuals and intuitive navigation. One of the key goals was to understande and create a responsive design that ensures accessibility across various devices.

## Projects
On the website are listed some of my projects, but the portfolio space could also be used as a gallery, as the design and logic behind it is similar.
It's not a complete nor a perfect website, but it serves as a starting point to further learn and develop ones ideas and future projects.

## Technologies Used
For the development of the website: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
Other projects are based on: C++, C, etc.
Other tools I'm currently working on: Unreal Engine 5.2 (UE5)

## License
